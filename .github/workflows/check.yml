# Note: This is adapted from jonhoo/rust-ci-conf/.github/workflows/check.yml

# This workflow runs whenever a PR is opened or updated, or a commit is pushed to main. It runs
# several checks:
# - fmt: checks that the code is formatted according to rustfmt
# - clippy: checks that the code does not contain any clippy warnings
# - doc: checks that the code can be documented without errors
# - msrv: check that the msrv specified in the crate is correct

# This configuration allows maintainers of this repo to create a branch and pull request based on
# the new branch. Restricting the push trigger to the main branch ensures that the PR only gets
# built once.
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, dev]
  pull_request:
# If new code is pushed to a PR branch, then cancel in progress workflows for that PR. Ensures that
# we don't waste CI time, and returns results quicker https://github.com/jonhoo/rust-ci-conf/pull/5
